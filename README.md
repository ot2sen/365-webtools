The opening entry in this webtools collection will show that the collection also will hold tools for tools.

Today I was using the wonderful Notepad++ for a basic volunteer task, and realised I didnÂ´t have a style colour selector within my tool.
After af few tries of different plugins, the following did exactly what I needed and had hoped for.

<b>nppqcp (free)</b> - [Quick Color Picker for Notepad++](https://code.google.com/p/nppqcp/)

There are tools you use every single day. To me these include screen capture of different types.

My favourite combination of tools for this purpose is:

<b>Snagit (paid)</b> - [Snagit Image and video screen capture](http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html)

and for full page website captures, editable before save I use  

<b>Nimbus (free)</b> - [Nimbus Screen Capture browser add-on](http://nimbus.everhelper.me/screenshot.php)
